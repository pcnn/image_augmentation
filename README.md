# Image augmentation package
Augmenting datasets of images is a common practice in training convolutional neural networks. Several methods for augmenting and degrading an image are implemented in this repository. This package can be used for modifying miages on-the-fly or modifying and storing them on disks.

The image in this repository is taken from [http://www.drodd.com/](http://www.drodd.com/images15/nature13.jpg)

## Requirements
This package depends on OpenCV and Numpy libraries.
